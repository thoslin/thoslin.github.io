I gave a [lightning talk](https://kccncosschn19eng.sched.com/event/910e362313be9cf58fce00a9b92a5adf) in [KubeCon 2019 Shanghai](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2019/) about how we use [istio](https://istio.io/) and [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest) for authorization.

The video is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctr2bVmzGpk) and the slides can be found [here](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccncosschn19eng/87/how-we-use-istio-and-opa-for-authorization.pdf).
