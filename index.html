  <h1>Attack Vectors in OAuth 2.0</h1>
  
  <p>Yesterday I was checking out which OAuth grant type is best fit for mobile applications. It turns out PKCE(Proof Key of Code Exchange) has become the de facto standard.</p>

<h2>The issue with implicit grant</h2>

<p>The flow for <a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/implicit.html">implicit grant</a> is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>User agent redirects resource owner to authorization server</li>
<li>Resource owner authorizes the access</li>
<li>User agent redirects resource owner back to the client application with an access token in URL fragment.</li>
</ul>


<p>In step 1, user agent, ie, mobile application, will normally open the browser to redirect resource owner to authorization server. The security implication here is that, using a web-view inside the application may expose resource owner credentials to application.</p>

<p>The attack vectors lie in step 3 after resource owner authorizes the access, the browser will redirect resource owner back to the application. For most mobile platforms, this is done by a special URL pattern, such as “com.foo.bar://callback-url”, applications bind handlers to this URL. So there’s a chance a malicious application also binds a handler to this URL, and gets the token in the URL fragment.</p>

<h2>Don’t ignore state parameter</h2>

<p>Another attack vector is that, a malicious user places his own access token in the URL fragment. Now the user’s session is replaced with the attacker’s session. The resource the user creates will actually show up in attacker’s account.</p>

<p>Therefore it is crucial for the client application to verify the state parameter after the redirect, to ensure that the session is the one resource owner initiates. The client may generate and store the state in cookie or session before the redirect to authorization server.</p>

<p>This is also the case for <a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code.html">authorization code grant</a> <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/#single-page-apps">without client_secret</a> (which is a trend to replace implicit grant). The attacker may authorize the authorization server with his own credentials, normally the redirect will happen. However the attacker traps the redirect, copy the URL, and send it to the target user, or initialize. A victim may already login, and clicks on the link, now he gets the attacker’s token, and session is replaced.</p>

<h2>PKCE to the rescue</h2>

<p>The implicit grant and the authorization code grant are both vulnerable if resource owner is redirected to a malicious client. But can we enforce some checks in the authorization server make sure the request comes from a valid client?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html">PKCE</a> solves this by introducing proof key for code exchange. It is an enhancement on authorization code grant thus the workflow is about the same, except the client needs to</p>

<ul>
<li>generate a key, which a random string and should be stored in the client.</li>
<li>generate a challenge from the key, which is base64encode(sha256(key)), should be sent to authorization server.</li>
</ul>


<p>So the idea here is that client sends the challenge in step 1 and prove it has the key to generate the  challenge when exchanging for token in step 3. Such that a malicious client is unable to obtain a code without the key, as it is only held by the righteous client.</p>

  <h1>Exception Handling: Go vs. Java</h1>
  
  <p>After reading this post <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2012/01/18/why-go-gets-exceptions-right">Why Go Gets Exceptions Right</a>, I have some thoughts and would like to write down here.</p>

<p>The first thing bumps to my head is why we&rsquo;re using exceptions in the first place. The answer seems clear, we want to signal the caller of our function that something went wrong.</p>

<p>So how do we do it? In Java we have exceptions, specially checked exceptions with <code>throws</code> keyword in the method signature. Checked means it will be checked by the compiler at the compile time, as a way to inform the caller that certain exceptions are expected to be thrown from the method.
While in go, with the ability to return multiple values, go informs the caller by returning an <code>error</code>. It is part of the function signature, the contract between the function and the caller, the caller should receive the result and the error correctly, otherwise the program won&rsquo;t compile.</p>

<p>Second thing I&rsquo;m wondering is that does Go really handle exceptions better than Java? Let&rsquo;s see how Go and Java handle them differently.</p>

<p>If we categorize the exceptions into following categories, language-ignostically(they&rsquo;re all concepts from Java, but can be interchangable for discussion):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Checked exceptions</em>. Something goes wrong, unpreventable but recoverable.</li>
<li><em>Runtime exceptions</em>. Something may go wrong, but preventable.</li>
<li><em>Errors</em>. Soemthing goes wrong, unpreventable and unrecoverable.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em>Checked exceptions</em></strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, checked exceptions are enforced for both Java and Go. And for the caller, they should handle the exception properly. Either try-catch in Java, or check if err is not nil in Go. And in go, you can ignore the error by using <code>_</code>, similarly, in Java you can try-catch the exception and does nothing about it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Runtime exceptions</em></strong></p>

<p>Runtime exceptions is the exceptions you can’t always detect at the compile time. It could be a null pointer exception, or a index out of bounds exception. In Java, as runtime exception is unchecked, you don&rsquo;t need to explicitly throws them in the method. In Go, you don&rsquo;t need to specify an error in the return statement. And for the caller, you have no idea what went wrong, you basically do nothing with it. Or you can explicitly try-catch in Java or <a href="https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover">defer-recover</a> in Go, otherwise, for Java the exception will bubble up the call stack until some exception handler catches it. And for Go, the panicking will also climb up the stack of the current goroutine until some recover happens. If none of this happens until main method, the program crashes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Error</em></strong></p>

<p>Errors are unpreventable and unrecoverable exceptions, like out of memory error. In Java you don&rsquo;t catch it and In Go you should just let it panic.</p>

<p>So viewing from this angle, the way Go and Java handles exceptions are almost the same. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think Go is better than Java in this regard. On the contrary, there are things I don’t like about error handling in Go:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not like Java, Go does not grap the error stacktrace by default. You may say it is not that expensive as Java and give you some flexibilities. However it is not good for debugging. If you’d like to print the stacktrace, you&rsquo;ll have to use libraries like github.com/pkg/errors to wrap the error with stack trace.</li>
<li>Not like Java, Go does not differentiate errors in function signature, you just have one error, it is like <code>throws Exception</code> in Java. You don’t know the exact errors you are expecting. Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Microservice health check in Kubernetes</h1>
  
  <h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>Service should provide a standard endpoint for the purpose of health check and monitoring. The specification for the endpoint should conform to the requirements as elaborated in section <a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a>.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<h2>what is health check</h2>

<p>A health check detects the healthy status of a service, reporting whether the service is able to handle requests or whether the service is in a bad state and should be restarted.</p>

<h2>Why health check is needed</h2>

<h3>High availability</h3>

<p>There are many cases when a service is started/restarted</p>

<ul>
<li>instance/pod restart</li>
<li>service/deployment up scaling</li>
<li>rolling update</li>
</ul>


<p>Under these circumstances, if a request is forwared to a service that is still in the middle of its starting/restarting process, it would probably fail. So we need to make sure a service is healthy to accept requests before adding it to the load balancer(kubernetes service), such that we could reduce the service down time and achieve high availability.</p>

<h3>Service stability</h3>

<p>Service running for a long period of time may fall into a bad state, in which service is unable to handle requests properly. In this case, service needs to be prohibited from receiving requests, until it is recovered either via restart or manual resurrection. Thus our service in all is stable.</p>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>A big part of the DevOps responsibilities is to monitor and maintain the health of running services. If a service goes down, appropriate actions should be undertaken to bring the service back to life. Health check informs the DevOps whether the service is malfunctioning.</p>

<h2>Clients of health checks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Load balancer (Kubernetes service)</li>
<li>Monitoring service (Prometheus probe)</li>
<li>Pods (Readiness/Liveness probe)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Downsides of health check</h2>

<p>As health check is done periodically, not in a real time manner, there still could be time gap before the unhealthy state is known to the clients. To mitigate the effect of this situation, a reasonable checking period should be set.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h2>What should be checked</h2>

<p>As the definition of healthy may vary from service to service, depending on the service application logics, there could be many levels of healthy:</p>

<ul>
<li>the service is up</li>
<li>the service is up and the infrastructure service used by the service is healthy</li>
<li>the service is up, the infrastructure service used by the service is healthy, the dependent microservice is healthy</li>
<li>the service is up, the infrastructure service used by the service is healthy, the dependent microservice is healthy, smoke tests are passed</li>
</ul>


<p>Each service may define its own criteria, however the result of these checks should be certain, ie, the service is either healthy or not healthy, there should be no middle state.</p>

<h2>How to expose health check to clients</h2>

<ul>
<li>The service should implement the health check in a RESTful API manner.</li>
<li>The endpoint is unified as &ldquo;/health&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h2>How health check respond to clients</h2>

<h3>Status code</h3>

<ul>
<li>200 OK for healthy</li>
<li>503 Service Unavailable for unhealthy</li>
</ul>


<h3>Response body</h3>

<p>Response body can be empty, however attaching additional information of what is checked and the result of the check is preferred</p>

<h2>Security/Access control</h2>

<p>The health check should be private and limited to internal access, however if it is open to public access:</p>

<ul>
<li>For unauthenticated access, service should provide a basic health info, returning a UP/DOWN status</li>
<li>For authenticated access, service may provide more detail health info</li>
</ul>
